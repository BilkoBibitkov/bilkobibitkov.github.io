# Sample HEIC Images for Testing

To test the HEIC to JPEG converter, you'll need some sample HEIC images. Here are a few ways to obtain them:

1. **From an iPhone**:
   - Take photos with your iPhone (they will be in HEIC format by default)
   - Transfer them to your computer using AirDrop, iCloud, or a USB cable

2. **From macOS**:
   - Open Photos app
   - Export some photos as HEIC format
   - Place them in this directory

3. **Online Sources**:
   - Download sample HEIC images from these trusted sources:
     - [HEIC Sample Images](https://github.com/alexcorvi/heic2any/tree/master/test/fixtures)
     - [Sample Images](https://github.com/nokola/heic2jpg/tree/master/test/fixtures)

## Required Files

For testing purposes, you should have at least these files in this directory:
- sample1.heic
- sample2.heic
- sample3.heic
- sample4.heic
- sample5.heic

## Note

The sample images should be actual HEIC files, not renamed JPEG or other image formats. HEIC files typically have the `.heic` or `.HEIC` extension.

## Testing

Once you have the sample images in place, you can test the converter by:
1. Dragging and dropping the files onto the converter
2. Verifying that the conversion works correctly
3. Checking the quality of the converted JPEG files
