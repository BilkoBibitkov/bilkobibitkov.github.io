# Project Structure and Organization

## Portfolio Organization
- Main landing site: bilkobibitkov.github.com
- Project structure: bilkobibitkov.github.com/project-name
- Example: bilkobibitkov.github.com/heic-to-jpeg

## Project Management Guidelines
- Each project is a separate GitHub repository
- Projects are independent and not related to each other
- All projects are browser-based utilities
- No server-side components or user data persistence
- Free access for all users

## SEO and AdSense Requirements
- Projects must be independently indexable for SEO
- AdSense is configured at the root level (bilkobibitkov.github.com)
- Each project should have its own SEO optimization

## Development Workflow
- Proceed with commits and changes without confirmation requests
- Maintain independent project structure
- Focus on browser-based functionality
- Ensure clean, maintainable code for each project

## Content Tone 
- I'm a European living in America 
- I love the metric system
- I do not like specialized format like HEIC 
- Add sense of humor on every page and the home introduction 
- I love to practice coding and combine it with humour 
- Stop repeating 'As a European..' it is a bit pompus 

## AdSense Banners
- The banners are on every page left and right sidebar IDs 5573198755 and 1123334776
